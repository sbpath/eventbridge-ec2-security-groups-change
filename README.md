# Introduction
This project helps to remediate newly created ec2 security groups created with 0.0.0.0/0, replaces with approved subnet defined in lambda variable (example vpc subnet 10.0.0.0/16). Also validates if the creation of the SG is from IAM group defined in exclude group (example Operations group who can only create groups with 0.0.0.0/0).
We will be using below events from event bridge rules to capure changes to security groups and call lambda fuction which can remediate the security groups.

AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
ModifySecurityGroupRules

# Lambda
Create lambda function (example: ec2-security-group-remediation), use IAM policy above. During testing python 3.10 was selected as runtime. For the function to work, please add below 2 variable once created.

EXCLUDE_GROUP = "Add the group name who's allowed to create 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR, if matching the lambda function will skip running the checks"
PREDEFINED_CIDR = <Input CIDR that you want to replace 0.0.0.0/0 with"

Lambda timeout was increased to 30 seconds for APIs to work, tune as required.

Deploy lambda from function attached "ec2-sg-state-change.py"

# Event Bridge

Create Event Bridge Rule with below event pattern, select target as lambda function created above.

{
  "source": ["aws.ec2"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventSource": ["ec2.amazonaws.com"],
    "eventName": ["AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress", "AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress", "ModifySecurityGroupRules"]
  }
}


# Instructions to deploy using samcli

> Open CloudShell service from AWS console
> Clone the repo and deploy the function using sam cli.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sbpath/eventbridge-ec2-security-groups-change.git
$ sam build
$ sam deploy -g
(Here you need to pass in Groupname to exclude and subnet to replace with)
> Update runtime to python 3.10 from lambda console.
```

> To delete the cloudformation stack:
```
$ sam delete
```
